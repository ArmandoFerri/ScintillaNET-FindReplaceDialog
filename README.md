# ScintillaNET

ScintillaNET is a Windows Forms control, wrapper, and bindings for the versatile [Scintilla](http://www.scintilla.org/) source code editing component.

> "As well as features found in standard text editing components, Scintilla includes features especially useful when editing and debugging source code. These include support for syntax styling, error indicators, code completion and call tips. The selection margin can contain markers like those used in debuggers to indicate breakpoints and the current line. Styling choices are more open than with many editors, allowing the use of proportional fonts, bold and italics, multiple foreground and background colours and multiple fonts." -- [scintilla.org](http://www.scintilla.org/)

ScintillaNET can also be used with WPF using the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.integration.windowsformshost(v=vs.110).aspx">WindowsFormsHost</a>.

### Project Status

ScintillaNET is in active development. If you find any issues or just have a question feel free to use the [Issues](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET/issues) feature at our GitHub page.

Compiled versions which are production ready can be downloaded from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/jacobslusser.ScintillaNET) or the [Releases](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET/releases) page.

For the latest and greatest you can build the [Master](https://github.com/jacobslusser/ScintillaNET/archive/master.zip) branch from source using Visual Studio 2013.

## Background

This project is a rewrite of the [ScintillaNET project hosted at CodePlex](http://scintillanet.codeplex.com/) and maintained by myself and others. After many years of contributing to that project I decided to think differently about the API we had created and felt I could make better one if I was willing to go back to a blank canvas. Thus, this project is the spiritual successor to the original ScintillaNET but has been written from scratch.
